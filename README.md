## Why this guide?

I fell in love with Zen not too long ago and as a Web Developer, there's just tons of little details that are just so much better than anything else out there, I can't even go back to Vivaldi. But I noticed it was slower than Chrome (Vivaldi is 30% slower already, but you can't optimize it), and so of course I spent months optimizing Zen until it got almost as fast as Chrome or Brave (Brave is like 5% faster than Chrome, mine scored 13.3 on my best speedometer test). And then I decided to share it because I keep seeing people complaining about performances on reddit.
